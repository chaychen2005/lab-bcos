## Getting Started

### Build a blockchain

Run [`build_chain.sh`](tools/build_chain.sh) to generate a blockchain with some nodes. For example, we build a blockchain with 4 nodes belongs to `127.0.0.1`.

```bash
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FISCO-BCOS/lab-bcos/dev/tools/build_chain.sh
bash build_chain.sh -l "127.0.0.1:4"
```

After that, we start up all nodes. And the blockchain is running!

```bash
cd ./nodes
bash start_all.sh
```
